### ERC20: Rebasing Tokens Vulnerability in Solidity

Rebasing tokens, such as Olympus DAO’s sOhm token and Ampleforth’s AMPL token, adjust their total supply periodically. This means that everyone's balance increases or decreases depending on the rebase direction. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities when interacting with these tokens.

#### Example of Vulnerable Code

Here's an example of a contract that is likely to break when dealing with a rebasing token:

```solidity
contract WillBreak {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceHeld;
    IERC20 private rebasingToken;

    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        balanceHeld[msg.sender] = amount;
        rebasingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        uint256 amount = balanceHeld[msg.sender];
        delete balanceHeld[msg.sender];

        // ERROR: amount might exceed the amount 
        // actually held by the contract
        rebasingToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

In this code, the `withdraw` function assumes that the `amount` stored in `balanceHeld` is the same as the amount held by the contract. However, due to rebasing, the actual balance held by the contract might be different, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

#### Prevention

To prevent this issue, you can modify the code to check the actual balance of the contract before transferring the amount to the sender. Here's an improved version of the contract:

```solidity
contract SafeRebasingTokenInteraction {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceHeld;
    IERC20 private rebasingToken;

    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        balanceHeld[msg.sender] = amount;
        rebasingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        uint256 amount = balanceHeld[msg.sender];
        delete balanceHeld[msg.sender];

        uint256 contractBalance = rebasingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 transferAmount = amount > contractBalance ? contractBalance : amount;

        rebasingToken.transfer(msg.sender, transferAmount);
    }
}
```

In this improved version, the `withdraw` function checks the actual balance of the contract using `rebasingToken.balanceOf(address(this))` before transferring the amount to the sender. This ensures that the contract does not attempt to transfer more tokens than it actually holds, preventing potential errors.

#### Key Takeaways

- **Account for Rebasing**: When dealing with rebasing tokens, always account for the possibility that the token balance may change due to rebasing.
- **Check Actual Balances**: Use balance checks before transfers to ensure that the contract does not attempt to transfer more tokens than it actually holds.

By following these practices, you can avoid issues related to rebasing tokens in Solidity and ensure that your smart contracts behave as expected.

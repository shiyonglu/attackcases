# Solidity Rounding Errors Vulnerability

#### Context
Solidity does not support floating-point numbers, so rounding errors are inevitable. Developers must be conscious of whether to round up or down and in whose favor the rounding should be.

#### Example
Consider the following code that incorrectly converts between stablecoins with different decimal places:

```solidity
contract Exchange {
    uint256 private constant CONVERSION = 1e12;

    function swapDAIForUSDC(uint256 usdcAmount) external pure returns (uint256 a) {
        uint256 daiToTake = usdcAmount / CONVERSION;
        conductSwap(daiToTake, usdcAmount);
    }
}
```

In this example, USDC has 6 decimals, and DAI has 18 decimals. The `CONVERSION` factor is used to adjust for the difference in decimal places. However, the division operation rounds down, potentially resulting in `daiToTake` being zero when `usdcAmount` is small. This allows a user to take a small amount of USDC for free when exchanging for DAI.

#### Prevention
To prevent rounding errors, consider the following strategies:

1. **Perform Division Last**: Ensure that division operations are performed last to minimize rounding errors.
2. **Use SafeMath Library**: Utilize the SafeMath library to handle arithmetic operations safely.
3. **Implement Rounding Logic**: Explicitly implement rounding logic to handle edge cases.

Here's an improved version of the code:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract Exchange {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    uint256 private constant CONVERSION = 1e12;

    function swapDAIForUSDC(uint256 usdcAmount) external pure returns (uint256 a) {
        uint256 daiToTake = usdcAmount.mul(CONVERSION).div(1e18);
        conductSwap(daiToTake, usdcAmount);
    }
}
```

In this improved version, the `SafeMath` library is used to handle arithmetic operations safely, and the division is performed last to minimize rounding errors.

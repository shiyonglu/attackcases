# Solidity Signatures Vulnerability: `ecrecover` Returns `address(0)`
The `ecrecover` function in Solidity is used to recover the address associated with a given signature. However, if the signature is invalid, `ecrecover` returns `address(0)` instead of reverting. This can lead to vulnerabilities if an uninitialized variable (which defaults to `address(0)`) is compared to the output of `ecrecover`.

#### Example
Consider the following vulnerable code:

```solidity
contract InsecureContract {
    address signer; 
    // defaults to address(0)

    function airdrop(address who, uint256 amount, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
        // ecrecover returns address(0) if the signature is invalid
        require(signer == ecrecover(keccak256(abi.encode(who, amount)), v, r, s), "invalid signature");
        mint(msg.sender, AIRDROP_AMOUNT);
    }
}
```

In this example, if the signature is invalid, `ecrecover` returns `address(0)`. Since `signer` is uninitialized and defaults to `address(0)`, the `require` statement will pass, allowing unauthorized users to call the `airdrop` function.

#### Prevention
To prevent this vulnerability, consider the following strategies:

1. **Initialize Variables Properly**: Ensure that variables are properly initialized and not left to their default values.
2. **Check for `address(0)`**: Explicitly check for `address(0)` in the `require` statement to ensure that the recovered address is valid.
3. **Use a Separate Function for Signature Verification**: Implement a separate function to verify the signature and handle invalid signatures appropriately.

Here's an improved version of the code:

```solidity
contract SecureContract {
    address signer;

    function airdrop(address who, uint256 amount, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
        address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(keccak256(abi.encode(who, amount)), v, r, s);
        require(recoveredAddress != address(0), "invalid signature");
        require(signer == recoveredAddress, "invalid signer");

        mint(msg.sender, AIRDROP_AMOUNT);
    }
}
```

In this improved version, the `recoveredAddress` is checked to ensure it is not `address(0)`, and the `signer` is compared to the `recoveredAddress` to verify the signature.

# Solidity Signature Replay Vulnerability
Signature replay occurs when a contract does not track if a signature has been used previously. This allows malicious actors to reuse a valid signature to perform the same action multiple times.

#### Example
Consider the following code that is vulnerable to signature replay attacks:

```solidity
contract InsecureContract {
    address signer;

    function airdrop(address who, uint256 amount, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
        address recovered = ecrecover(keccak256(abi.encode(who, amount)), v, r, s);
        require(recovered != address(0), "invalid signature");
        require(recovered == signer, "recovered signature not equal signer");

        mint(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `airdrop` function verifies the signature and mints tokens to the caller. However, it does not track if the signature has been used before, allowing users to claim the airdrop multiple times with the same signature.

#### Prevention
To prevent signature replay attacks, consider the following strategies:

1. **Track Used Signatures**: Maintain a mapping to track used signatures and ensure they cannot be reused.
2. **Include Nonce or Timestamp**: Include a nonce or timestamp in the signed message to ensure each signature is unique.

Here's an improved version of the code:

```solidity
contract SecureContract {
    address signer;
    mapping(bytes => bool) usedSignatures;

    function airdrop(address who, uint256 amount, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external {
        bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(abi.encode(who, amount));
        address recovered = ecrecover(messageHash, v, r, s);
        require(recovered != address(0), "invalid signature");
        require(recovered == signer, "recovered signature not equal signer");

        bytes memory signature = abi.encodePacked(v, r, s);
        require(!usedSignatures[signature], "signature already used");
        usedSignatures[signature] = true;

        mint(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

In this improved version, the `usedSignatures` mapping tracks used signatures to prevent replay attacks. Additionally, a nonce or timestamp can be included in the signed message to ensure each signature is unique.

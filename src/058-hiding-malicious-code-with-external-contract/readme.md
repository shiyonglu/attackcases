# Hiding Malicious Code with External Contract

#### Description:
In Solidity, any address can be cast into a specific contract type, even if the contract at that address is not the one being cast. This can be exploited to hide malicious code. An attacker can deploy a malicious contract and then cast it as a different, seemingly benign contract, tricking users into executing the malicious code.

#### Example:
Consider the following example:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Foo {
    Bar bar;

    constructor(address _bar) {
        bar = Bar(_bar);
    }

    function callBar() public {
        bar.log();
    }
}

contract Bar {
    event Log(string message);

    function log() public {
        emit Log("Bar was called");
    }
}

// Malicious contract
contract Mal {
    event Log(string message);

    function log() public {
        emit Log("Mal was called");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Foo` is designed to interact with `Bar`. However, an attacker can deploy `Mal` and pass its address to `Foo`'s constructor. When `Foo.callBar()` is called, it will execute `Mal.log()` instead of `Bar.log()`, hiding the malicious code¹.

#### Prevention:
1. **Initialize a New Contract Inside the Constructor**: Instead of accepting an external address, initialize the contract within the constructor to ensure it is the intended contract.
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract Foo {
       Bar public bar;

       constructor() {
           bar = new Bar();
       }

       function callBar() public {
           bar.log();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Make the Address of the External Contract Public**: By making the address of the external contract public, users can review the code of the external contract to ensure it is safe.
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract Foo {
       Bar public bar;

       constructor(address _bar) {
           bar = Bar(_bar);
       }

       function callBar() public {
           bar.log();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Use Trusted External Contracts**: Only use external contracts from trusted sources. Reputable security experts should audit and vet external contracts to ensure their security².

4. **Monitor External Contracts**: Keep an eye on the external contracts that your smart contracts use. If you notice any unexpected changes, investigate immediately².

By following these best practices, you can mitigate the risk of hiding malicious code with external contracts and enhance the security of your smart contracts.

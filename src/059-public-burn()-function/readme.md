# Public Burn Function Vulnerability

#### Description:
A public burn function allows anyone to call the burn function and burn tokens in a contract. This can be dangerous as it may lead to unauthorized token burning, which can manipulate token supply and potentially affect the token's value and liquidity. There have been several instances in the past where contracts with public burn functions were exploited¹.

#### Example:
Consider the following Solidity code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Token {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `burn` function is public, allowing any user to burn their tokens. However, if there are no proper access controls, it can lead to unauthorized burning of tokens¹.

#### Prevention:
1. **Implement Access Controls**: Use access control mechanisms like `onlyOwner` to restrict who can call the burn function.
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

   contract Token is Ownable {
       mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

       function burn(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
           require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
           balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Make the Function Internal**: Make the burn function internal and implement the correct access control logic.
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract Token {
       mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

       function _burn(uint256 amount) internal {
           require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
           balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
       }

       function burn(uint256 amount) public {
           _burn(amount);
       }
   }
   ```

By following these best practices, you can prevent unauthorized token burning and ensure the security of your smart contracts.

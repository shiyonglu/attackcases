# Inadherence to Standards in Solidity

Inadherence to standards in Solidity can lead to various issues, including security vulnerabilities, interoperability problems, and maintenance challenges. Let's explore some common areas where not following standards can cause problems and how to adhere to best practices.

In terms of smart contract development, it's important to follow standards. Standards are set to prevent vulnerabilities, and ignoring them can lead to unexpected effects.

Take for example binance's original BNB token. It was marketed as an ERC20 token, but it was later pointed out that it wasn't actually ERC20 compliant for a few reasons:

- It prevented sending to 0x0
- It blocked transfers of 0 value
- It didn't return true or false for success or fail

The main cause for concern with this improper implementation is that if it is used with a smart contract that expects an ERC-20 token, it will behave in unexpected ways. It could even get locked in the contract forever. 

Although standards aren't always perfect, and may someday become antiquated, they foster proper expectations to provide for secure smart contracts.


### Common Issues

1. **ERC Standards**: Not adhering to established ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) standards, such as ERC-20 for tokens or ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), can lead to interoperability issues with other contracts and platforms.

2. **Naming Conventions**: Using inconsistent naming conventions for functions, variables, and events can make the code harder to read and maintain.

3. **Documentation**: Lack of proper documentation can make it difficult for other developers to understand and use the contract.

4. **Security Best Practices**: Ignoring security best practices, such as input validation, access control, and safe math operations, can lead to vulnerabilities.

### Example

Consider a token contract that does not adhere to the ERC-20 standard:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract NonStandardToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
```

This contract lacks several essential functions and events defined in the ERC-20 standard, such as `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `Transfer` event. This makes it incompatible with wallets, exchanges, and other contracts that expect an ERC-20 compliant token.

### Best Practices

To adhere to standards and best practices, follow these guidelines:

1. **Follow ERC Standards**: Implement established ERC standards for tokens and other contract types. For example, use the OpenZeppelin library to create ERC-20 tokens:

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

   contract StandardToken is ERC20 {
       constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) {
           _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for functions, variables, and events. Follow the Solidity style guide for best practices.

3. **Proper Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly, including comments for functions, variables, and complex logic.

4. **Security Best Practices**: Follow security best practices, such as input validation, access control, and using safe math operations. Regularly review and update your code to address new security threats.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your smart contracts are secure, maintainable, and compatible with other contracts and platforms.

# External Contract Referencing

**External Contract Referencing** in Ethereum refers to the practice of one smart contract calling functions or accessing data from another contract. This is a common feature in Ethereum's decentralized ecosystem, allowing for modular and reusable code. However, it also introduces potential vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Explained
When a contract references an external contract, it relies on the external contract's code and state. If the external contract is malicious or compromised, it can lead to unexpected behavior or security breaches. For example, if a contract uses an external library for encryption, and the library's address is not fixed, an attacker could replace the library with a malicious one.

### Example
Consider a smart contract that uses an external library for encryption:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    address encryptionLibrary;

    constructor(address _library) {
        encryptionLibrary = _library;
    }

    function encryptData(bytes memory data) public view returns (bytes memory) {
        return encryptionLibrary.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("encrypt(bytes)", data));
    }
}
```

In this example, if the `encryptionLibrary` address is not fixed, an attacker could deploy a malicious contract at that address, causing the `encryptData` function to behave unexpectedly.

### Prevention Techniques
To prevent vulnerabilities associated with external contract referencing, consider the following techniques:

1. **Use Fixed Addresses**: Hardcode the addresses of trusted external contracts if they are known in advance.
2. **Create Instances at Deployment**: Use the `new` keyword to create instances of external contracts at deployment, ensuring they cannot be replaced without modifying the smart contract.
3. **Validate External Contracts**: Implement checks to ensure that the external contract's code and state are as expected before interacting with it.
4. **Use Interfaces**: Define interfaces for external contracts to ensure that the expected functions and data structures are present.

### Real-World Example: Re-Entrancy Honey-Pot
A well-known example of exploiting external contract referencing is the Re-Entrancy Honey-Pot. In this scenario, attackers attempt to exploit a contract by repeatedly calling an external contract, but end up losing Ether to the contract they intended to exploit¹².

By following these prevention techniques, developers can mitigate the risks associated with external contract referencing and build more secure smart contracts.

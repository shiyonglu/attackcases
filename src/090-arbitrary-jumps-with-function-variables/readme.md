# Arbitrary Jumps with Function Variables

**Arbitrary Jumps with Function Variables** in Ethereum refer to the ability to jump to any location within a contract's bytecode using assembly instructions. This can be a powerful feature but also introduces potential security risks.

### Explanation
In Ethereum's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), the `JUMP` and `JUMPI` instructions allow for jumping to specific locations in the bytecode. These instructions can be used to create dynamic and flexible control flows, but they must be used carefully to avoid vulnerabilities.

### Example
Consider a contract that uses assembly to perform an arbitrary jump:

```solidity
contract ArbitraryJump {
    function jumpTo(uint256 location) public {
        assembly {
            jump(location)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `jumpTo` function takes a location as an argument and uses the `JUMP` instruction to move the execution to that location. If the location is not carefully controlled, it could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

### Prevention Techniques
To prevent vulnerabilities associated with arbitrary jumps, consider the following techniques:

1. **Use `JUMPDEST`**: Ensure that all jump destinations are marked with the `JUMPDEST` opcode. This opcode is required for valid jump destinations and helps prevent jumping to invalid locations.
2. **Validate Jump Locations**: Implement checks to ensure that the jump location is within a valid range and points to a `JUMPDEST` opcode.
3. **Avoid Untrusted Input**: Do not use untrusted input to determine jump locations. Always validate and sanitize input before using it in a jump instruction.
4. **Use High-Level Constructs**: Whenever possible, use high-level Solidity constructs instead of low-level assembly to manage control flow. High-level constructs are less prone to errors and vulnerabilities.

### Real-World Example
A real-world example of the risks associated with arbitrary jumps is the potential for creating "jump-oriented programming" attacks. In such attacks, an attacker could manipulate the control flow of a contract to execute arbitrary code by carefully crafting jump locations.

By following these prevention techniques, developers can mitigate the risks associated with arbitrary jumps and build more secure smart contracts.
